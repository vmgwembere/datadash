# Data Dashboard

A project using D3.js and dc.js to visualise data of a fictional boarding school to show overall consumption and cost of vegtables and fruits to let owners and senior staff know whether more effort needs to be put into getting the student body eating more healthy and a rough estimate of the cost to the school to provide the fruit and veg. Also an extra data point to see overall how many students prefer to consume their fruit and veg through smoothies.
